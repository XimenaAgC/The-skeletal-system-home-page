The skeletal system is one of the most known systems due to its responsability to mantain a shape and protect organs. In order to know more about the ways that robotics can be envolved in diffrent areas and how or what are its restrictions of what is needed to know about the object of study that is going to guide us to a good use of tecnology, an investigation of the skeletal system was made.<br>
<br>The skeletal system is a dynamic structure made mainly of bones, but also includes tendons, ligaments and cartilage. Also, there are three types of skeletal system: Hydrostatic, which is hollow and that is mainly in soft-body animals, Exoskeleton, made of chitin and it is seen on insects, Endoskeleton, made by bones and the ones that many animals have, including the human being.  In the human being there are 206 bones, the result of the fusion of their bones in the natal stage. The human endoskeleton can be devided into the axial skeleton (composed by skull, ossicles, hyoid, vertebral column and rib cage) and the appendicular skeleton (composed by arms, hands, shoulder girdle, legs, feet and pelvis girdle). Each bone has different cells and functions that compose the skeletal system, and as well as the previous system, they have a classification according to its shape, which is: long bones, short bones, flat bones and irregular bones. The bones are tissues made by collagen, but, being more specific, they have are constituted by two layers; compact bones, the rough tissue in the exterior, and spongy bone tissue, the layer where you found yellow and red marrow.

<br>Journey (Hypothesis)
By the usage of robotics it is possible to replace or improve the usage of some skeletal components.

The robot will go over you skull, and it is capable of taking pictures, to convert them into radiographs to detect bone cancer by gammagrahis which goes all over your bones </h3>
